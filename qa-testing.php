                    QA testing, or Quality Assurance testing, is a critical process in software development and other industries where the quality and functionality of products or services need to be verified before they are released to customers or users. The primary goal of QA testing is to identify and address defects, inconsistencies, or issues in a product to ensure that it meets the desired quality standards and functions as intended.

                    <p class="card-text  text-muted text-center">
                      1 Defect Identification: QA testers are responsible for finding defects or bugs in the software, which can include functional issues, usability problems, security vulnerabilities, and more. These defects can range from minor glitches to critical errors that impact the software's functionality.
                      2 Test Planning: Before testing begins, QA teams create detailed test plans that outline the scope of testing, the test cases to be executed, and the testing methodologies to be used. This planning phase helps ensure comprehensive testing coverage.
                      3 Test Execution: QA testers execute test cases, interact with the software or application, and record the results. They compare the actual results with expected results to identify discrepancies.
                      4 Bug Reporting: When defects are identified, QA testers document them in bug reports, including detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and severity levels. These reports are then shared with the development team for resolution.
