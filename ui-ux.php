                      UI Design is the process of making the app look good. Itâ€™s during the UI process that the visual presentation of an app is decided. UI designers are responsible for making sure each screen a user encounters has a consistent and appealing look and feel.

                       UI design focuses on the visual aspects of a product or application, including its layout, colors, typography, and overall look and feel. It is concerned with how users interact with the interface and how the elements are presented to enhance usability.
                       UX design is about creating a positive, efficient, and enjoyable experience for users when interacting with a product or service. It encompasses every aspect of the user's interaction with the product.
